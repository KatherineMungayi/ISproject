# ISproject

This project is a Tuberculosis detection system which will intergrate a machine learning model that will learn through Chest X-rays to determine whether a patient is positive or negative for Tuberculosis disease.
The front end will be a web application which will enable the doctors/radiologist to upload the chest-x ray image which will be fed into the model and a prediction given as feedback.
